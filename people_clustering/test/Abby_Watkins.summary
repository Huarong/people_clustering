Ines Papert picks up her son Manu and hangs him by his arms from the warm-up structure. We are in isolation at the Ice World Cup. Eight men and eight women pack the tiny room, stretching, tightening crampons, �ling picks. Manu giggles and flails his legs around as Ines spots him. She smiles and encourages him. I look around at the other climbers, most are tight-lipped and focused. Between entertaining Manu, Ines casually warms up and stretches, then walks out and hikes to the anchors of another IWC �nal route. For Ines, motherhood and top-level climbing appear to be the most natural of combinations. For most people, just one of these occupations takes all of their energy. After Manu’s birth, Ines stopped working at her job as a physiotherapist. She discovered, “I was more motivated and successful in climbing...and wanted to prove that the climbing lifestyle is not �nished if you have children.” In the 2002 Ice World Cup, Ines put her foot outside the boundary line in the �rst competition, disqualifying her for that round and ultimately denying her the top place on the podium in the overall standings. Her mother shook her head and sighed, “I guess we will be doing this again next year.” Ines returned and swept the Ice World Cup in 2003, winning all four events by a sweeping margin. Winning may look easy for Ines. However, behind it all is a long stretch of hard work; the organizing of babysitters, the choosing of safe climbing locations so that Manu can come along, the sheer motivation of making time to train and practice technical moves, the preparation of ice tools and crampons. The competitions represent the split-second encountered when crossing a �nish line. Although focusing on competition climbing for the past few years, Ines does not identify herself as a competition climber. She also cranks on real rock and ice, witnessed by her completion of Mission Impossible M11, Europe's hardest testpiece in just two attempts. (see inset) For now, however, she avoids hazardous climbing saying, “I would like to do more alpine routes but my son is still very young and needs his mother...but in some years I would like to do more in the mountains, perhaps an expedition with girls.” Ines is clearly setting new standards, taking climbing in her stride on the side of a dedicated motherhood. She inspires us to rethink our own preconceptions of women and climbing—perhaps it is more natural to us than we ever imagined. Abby Watkins — Not many people can set numerous speed-climbing records, onsight 12b and lead M8+ mixed lines. But Abby can. These days, she could probably do it with her eyes closed. This hard-charging lass has taken home several competitive titles, put up alpine lines in the Nangmah Valley in Pakistan and participates in a four-person aerial-dance company that performs internationally. What’s she been up to lately? “Well, I just spent a week hanging upside down in my BD harness rehearsing and performing aerial dance. This kind of work tests the comfort of my harness more than anything else.” We’re happy we can help Abby.
